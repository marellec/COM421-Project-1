I chose to break each module into separate pages by the given 
header hierarchy. The case studies are separated into divs with a 
contrasting style to stand out from the blocks of text.
I decided that the sidebars should be inline 
with the text instead of having a separate column for them or 
having them break up the sequence of the text. My header styling 
for the module navigation page is a little more complicated 
than needed, so I would have simplified the styling if I 
had more time. The navigation pages for the modules and home page 
are simple lists with little styling, but the ones with subheaders 
at least show the structure using subbullet points. I would have 
added some floating buttons to the modules so that users can flip 
to the next/previous page instead of clicking on the side navigation. 
I would also add a home button to the module pages so the user can 
click once to exit the entire module.
