                Analyzing descriptive statistics may lead you to ask new questions. For example, <em>perc_enjoy</em> is much higher on average than <em>perc_usefulness</em>, which also has a large variance. This suggests that a segment of users may not have considered the system useful even though they enjoyed using it.

        <p>
            Run descriptive (summary) statistics on the dataset and output results in a new spreadsheet. If necessary, rearrange columns so that data requiring summary, those with <strong>continuous</strong>, values are adjacent. 
            (In the spreadsheet, the continuous values of <em>perc_enjoy</em>, <em>perc_usefulness</em>, and <em>perc_ease_of_use</em> are already adjacent.)
        </p>

        <p>
            Write down the "input range" (i.e. H2:J26) of the data requiring summary, making sure not to include variable labels.

            The descriptive statistics summary will output in a new sheet. Rename this spreadsheet Descriptive_Stats. Label the output according to the variables. For example, <em>Column 1</em> should be <em>perc_enjoy</em>. Your Descriptive_Stats spreadsheet should now look like Figure 4.

            Analyzing descriptive statistics is a great way to start appraising a dataset before running inferential statistics. What insights about the dataset can you glean from the summary statistics for <em>perc_usefulness</em> and <em>perc_ease_of_use</em>?
