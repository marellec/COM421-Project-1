                Open PASW and upload the spreadsheet. 
                (IIT labs in Stuart Building, room 112, have PASW. You can also download a 30-day free trial.)

                Under PASW's <strong>Analyze</strong> menu, see if you can also find the following:

                You should have determined that the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance is the appropriate test. 
                Go to <strong>Analyze > Nonparametric Tests > K Independent Samples..</strong>. A new window will open prompting you to select the variables (by column name) to be tested.

                <li><p>Select the <em>perc_usefulness</em> variable from the scrollable list on the left, and click the top arrow to move it to the Test Variable List (i.e. dependent variable).</p></li>
                <li><p>Select the <em>free_play</em> variable from the scrollable list, and click the bottom arrow to move it to the Grouping Variable section (i.e. independent variable).</p></li>
                <li><p>Click <strong>Define Range..</strong>., and enter "0" in the Minimum field and "1" in the Maximum field. This specifies the two categorical variables to be tested. Your screen should now look like Figure 6. Click Continue.</p></li>

                Because statistical analysis output contains many numerical components (some of which must be cited in formal reports), it is a good idea to save it to a format independent of the PASW software. 
                To save the results, go to <strong>File > Export</strong>. Change Document Type to the desired output format (Word, Excel, PDF, etc.), then click OK.
